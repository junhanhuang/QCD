# Reproducible code for “Quantum-inspired clustering and trajectory inference for single-cell omics using a coherent Ising machine”

This repository enables **full reproduction of all figures and tables** in the paper using the provided data and scripts.

Content:
- Python: full code for Leiden and spectral clustering baselines
- R: complete Slingshot + dynbenchmark pipeline
- Pre-computed **QCD cluster labels** generated on a real 400-pulse coherent Ising machine
- One-command reproduction of **Table 1** and **Figure 6**

The QCD solver itself requires proprietary control software for the photonic hardware and is available upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.
